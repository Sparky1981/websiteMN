    This creature may appear to be alone when you first encounter it; but don't be fooled. When I did there was another of it's kind there,  walking in the opposite direction, another type of Enemy was also walking, this was carrying a very long axe which is capable of a considerable swing circle and reach.
    
    I'm not revealing the full count, that would spoil everything.

        This Mimic character is a pretty mischevious Sod; it disguises itself as a Treasure Chest.
        I          found that out
        when I first encountered it.  I pressed the X on my PS4 Controller, the Treasure, nastily opened up,
        two arms appeared grabbing my in game character and pulling it into the creatures mouth, and before I knew it I was caught in an unescapable sequence of events; I was being eaten, which meant my Character was now dead!!! That taught me not to rush into opening things without knowing what might happen.

    The Grave Warden, can be a slow moving enemy; but it can be fast with the hits it manages to get out when it attacks, and it does in groups. And a couple of these can decimate the health of the player, when they team up.
