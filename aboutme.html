<h1> You've Got A Friend Indeed!!!</h1>
<p class="welcome"> Welcome this is just a little section on what NPC's can help you out with in the Game.. </p>
<h2><font face="Verdana">Blacksmith Andre</font></h2>

    Andre is quite a useful NPC, you can talk to him about things game related, upgrade/repair your equipment, but these all come at a cost; and cash does not work in this Undead World. Souls are Currency, but he also needs Estus Shards. He can also help you to upgrade your Estus Flask which gives you more chances of survival, when you sit at the Bonfire (you start with 2). Personally I say that upgrading this will give you more chance of survival during Boss fights.

    I was amazed firstly when I came across this character, she spoke with a sweetly dark tone; I didn't know whether to be scared or not!! She provides you with ways to Level UP, which included raising your health stats, etc. My Character started at a Paltry 9, but this was raised to 19 after several visits, definitely Souls well spent.

<h2><font face="Verdana">Greirat</font></h2>

    This character is not quite easily to interact with his, as he's locked up a Prison cell; and after considerable time searching for his location, then the key to release him, you have to fight your way through various enemies (all of varying degrees of toughness) to get it.
